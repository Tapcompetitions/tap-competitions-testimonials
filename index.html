                    <div class="text">I was pretty skeptical about this at first, but I was offered an entry at a reduced price, so I thought I would give it a go. I got the text at 7:30 pm Sunday night and then had a countdown of 30 minutes. Once the countdown was over, I hit the blue button. About a minute or two later, I received an email saying that I ranked 8th. I got a phone call today to organize payment of $150 and have received it. I will definitely have a crack at the next competition!</div>

The process is fair, and everyone has an equal chance to win, unlike other competitions that require you to buy multiple tickets to increase your chances. Great work by the team – worth checking out and entering!</div>
